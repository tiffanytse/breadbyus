          <h4> A BIT ABOUT US </h4> 
        	<p>We are a small-batch artisanal bread bakery, creating organic sourdough breads, proudly situated in the heart of beautiful Hintonburg, Ottawa.  We believe a bakery isn't quite complete without the smells and tastes of exceptional coffee, so we offer Hintonburg's own Happy Goat coffee at our cozy espresso bar.</p>
          <p><strong>We are serious about what we like - bread and coffee - and aim to give you the best loaf and brew that we can. </strong> </p>
          <p>We strive to give customers the sensory experience of a bakery full of aromatic breads of many varieties, with beautiful esthetics, every day. Our menu is simple and that's how we like it. Our approach to bread is to respect the inherent properties and potential of the grains. Nature provides us with so many wonderful varieties of wheat and grains, so we try not to mess with it too much.  Our slow and thoughtful techniques are meant to extract the complex and wonderful trapped flavour potential of the grains themselves.  We are a back-to-basics kind of place. Straightforward, delicious, and consistent.</p>
          <p>We do our best to support local suppliers because we love our home and we love the bounty that comes from it. We are dedicated to sustainable environmental practices, and creating a healthy and prosperous work environment within our own walls. </p>
