            <h4> A BIT ABOUT US </h4> 
          	<p>We are a small-batch artisanal bread bakery, creating organic sourdough breads, proudly situated in the heart of beautiful Hintonburg, Ottawa.  We believe a bakery isn't quite complete without the smells and tastes of exceptional coffee, so we offer Hintonburg's own Happy Goat coffee at our cozy espresso bar.</p>
            <p><strong>We are serious about what we like - bread and coffee - and aim to give you the best loaf and brew that we can. </strong> </p>
            <p>We strive to give customers the sensory experience of a bakery full of aromatic breads of many varieties, with beautiful esthetics, every day. Our menu is simple and that's how we like it. Our approach to bread is to respect the inherent properties and potential of the grains. Nature provides us with so many wonderful varieties of wheat and grains, so we try not to mess with it too much.  Our slow and thoughtful techniques are meant to extract the complex and wonderful trapped flavour potential of the grains themselves.  We are a back-to-basics kind of place. Straightforward, delicious, and consistent.</p></div>
              <div class="about col right">
              <p>We do our best to support local suppliers because we love our home and we love the bounty that comes from it. We are dedicated to sustainable environmental practices, and creating a healthy and prosperous work environment within our own walls. </p>

          <div class="about col left">
            <h4> Access </h4> 
          	<p>We believe that bread and coffee made with good quality ingredients and lots of love should be available for all to enjoy, regardless of how deep your pockets are. We are always trying to think of ways to make this a reality that does not compromise our ability to thrive as a business. Our commitment to living wages, organic flour, and directly traded coffee means we need to get creative in fulfilling this mission.</p>
           
            <p>Luckily there are other folks out there who are also pondering this conundrum. One of the ways you can help us with our mission is to participate in the growing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SuspendedCoffeess">Suspended Coffee </a> movement. The idea is simple; if you are picking up your loaf or cup of coffee, and you have some spare change, buy a second one and leave it in the store. We'll make a note of it so that it is visible to future customers, and the next person to come in who might be short on cash can claim that purchase, no questions asked. </p></div>
              <div class="about col right">
              <p>We all win--the person who picked up their fresh loaf or coffee and now has some wholesome food or a drink to warm them up, the donor has made a meaningful contribution with an immediate tangible payoff, and we get to experience the joy of sharing our goods with someone who may not have otherwise walked into our store. </p>
              
<p>So whether you're someone who needs a hand, or someone willing to lend one, please drop in and participate in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SuspendedCoffeess">Suspended</a> program.  </p>

              <h4> BREADS</h4> 
              <p>Our baker Jess is bread-obsessed. It is a serious love-affair. For her, bread is comfort, nostalgia, communal, and joyous. Sharing good bread that is both delicious and accessible is her goal.
Our approach to bread is to respect the inherent properties and potential of the grains. Nature provides us with so many wonderful varieties of wheat and grains, so we try not to mess with it too much.  Our slow and thoughtful techniques are meant to extract the complex and wonderful trapped flavour potential of the grains themselves.</p>
<p>On any given day, you are likely to see most of the staples: croissants first thing in the morning, followed by big crusty country loaves, followed by baguettes, rye loaves, whole wheat, and Jess' favourite - focaccia around lunch time. And then depending on the day of the week, we will be showcasing some more special varieties - whole spelt, luxurious brioche, milk bread, nut and seed breads, ciabatta, olive bread (extra olives of course), and rolls.</p></div>

<h5>Just so you know...</h5>
            <p>In our bakery, sourdough isn't just an option, it is the way. So to some extent, almost every loaf will come to life with the help of our sourdough culture. In some breads, the sourness will be the star; in others, it will be subtle or barely detectable. Sourness is not only great for surprising and complex flavour, but it also helps our breads last longer without adding any preservatives, even when there in just small quantities. </p>

              <h4> COFFEE</h4> 
            <p> We love to take a minute and enjoy the smells and taste of our coffee. We hope you like coffee Zen as much as we do.</p>
<p>Much like our approach to bread, our approach to coffee is to showcase the abundance of variety and complexity of coffee beans. Like wheat, coffee beans have tons of trapped potential; it is up to skilled roasters and baristas to extract as much flavour and character as they can. We strive first and foremost for quality and consistency. Secondarily, we want to showcase the nuances and complexities of different roasts and blends. </p>
<h5><center>Happy Goat has shared our love and passion for coffee, and have been instrumental in supporting Us since day 1.</center></h5></div>

<p>Here's a bit about them, straight from the mouth of the <a href="www.happygoatcoffee.com">Goat</a>: </p>
<p class="italic">Happy Goat Coffee starts with the small farmers of Africa, Asia, Central and South America. These small-scale farmers produce niche coffees and have distinct characteristics that connect to their local ecology. Small-scale farmers produce exceptional coffee beans which cater to niche artisan roasters like us. In contrast, mass market coffee roasters focus on uniformity and low cost. Mass market coffee producers undermines the market for specialty coffee which causes small farmers to go out of business and is killing the genetic diversity of the worlds coffee.</p>
<p class="italic">At Happy Goat Coffee we promote the niche coffee market by encouraging neighborhood based small batch coffee roasting, we also encourage people to home roast with easy to use home roasting machines.
Protecting and preserving small-scale farming through niche markets helps the environment, empowers small farmers and their local economies while maintaining the world's store of genetic diversity. Just as importantly, freshly roasted coffee bean creates superior coffee. </p>
